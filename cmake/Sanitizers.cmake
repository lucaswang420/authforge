# cmake/Sanitizers.cmake
# Optional ThreadSanitizer (TSan) / AddressSanitizer (ASan) toggle for the
# test target of the concurrency & lifetime safety audit.
#
# Cache option (single-value enum -> TSan and ASan are mutually exclusive):
#   OAUTH2_SANITIZER = off (default) | thread | address
#
#   thread  -> -fsanitize=thread  -g -fno-omit-frame-pointer
#   address -> -fsanitize=address -g -fno-omit-frame-pointer
#
# Rules:
#   * GCC/Clang only. MSVC does not accept the GCC/Clang `-fsanitize=` flags and
#     has no ThreadSanitizer runtime; Clang targeting the MSVC ABI
#     (clang-cl / *-pc-windows-msvc) has no TSan runtime either. In those cases
#     the option is ignored with a WARNING so the normal build still succeeds.
#   * Intended for Debug builds only (Sanitizer 仅用于 Debug 构建). A WARNING is
#     emitted for non-Debug build types.
#   * TSan and ASan cannot be enabled simultaneously — the single-value enum
#     enforces this (you select exactly one of off/thread/address per build).
#     Run two separate builds to cover both.
#
# Provides function oauth2_apply_sanitizer(target) which appends the selected
# `-fsanitize` flags to BOTH the COMPILE and LINK options of `target`.
#
# _Spec: concurrency-lifetime-safety-audit, Task 0 (TSan/ASan scaffolding)_
# _Requirements: 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, 2.8, 2.9, 2.10, 2.11_
