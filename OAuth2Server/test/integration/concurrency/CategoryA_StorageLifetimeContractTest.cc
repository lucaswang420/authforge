// OAuth2Server/test/integration/concurrency/CategoryA_StorageLifetimeContractTest.cc
//
// Spec: concurrency-lifetime-safety-audit — Task 1 (Category A reproduction).
// Property 1: Bug Condition — Init-Order Safety — covers 1.3 (raw storage
// pointer lifetime contract fragility).
//
// METHODOLOGY (read carefully):
//   This test runs on the UNFIXED code (F) and DOCUMENTS the fragility of the
//   implicit raw-pointer ownership contract between OAuth2Plugin::storage_ and
//   the services that hold storage_.get(). It does NOT modify production code
//   and does NOT attempt to trigger a real heap-use-after-free — the genuine
//   UAF reproduction belongs to Task 3 (Category C, under AddressSanitizer),
//   which can construct the shutdown-vs-in-flight-callback race against the
//   real storage. SIOF and raw-pointer lifetime issues are timing / link-order
//   dependent and do NOT crash deterministically in a single in-process build.
//
//   Production fact being modelled (see OAuth2Plugin.{h,cc}):
//     * storage_ is `std::unique_ptr<IOAuth2Storage>`.
//     * tokenService_/clientService_/identityService_/cleanupService_ are
//       constructed with `storage_.get()` — they hold a RAW `IOAuth2Storage*`.
//     * OAuth2Plugin::shutdown() calls `cleanupService_->stop()` and then
//       `storage_.reset()` — releasing the storage WHILE the service objects
//       are still alive and still holding the now-dangling raw pointer. Any
//       in-flight async callback dereferencing that raw pointer after reset()
//       is a use-after-free. The contract "storage outlives every user" is an
//       implicit timing convention, NOT enforced by the type system.
//
//   Here we reproduce that ownership SHAPE with a minimal, self-contained model
//   (no DB/Redis needed) and assert — DETERMINISTICALLY — that after the owner
//   resets its unique_ptr, the captured raw pointer is left dangling while the
//   holder is still alive. We never dereference the dangling pointer; we detect
//   the unsafe window via an external liveness sentinel. The test PASSES on the
//   unfixed code: the "pass" is the *documentation of fragility* (raw pointer
//   diverges from owner; holder cannot detect the death). After the 1.3 fix
//   (storage_ -> shared_ptr), the same shape would keep the storage alive as
//   long as a holder references it (asserted again at task 6.4).
//
// _Requirements: 2.1, 2.2, 2.3_  (design Property 1)
