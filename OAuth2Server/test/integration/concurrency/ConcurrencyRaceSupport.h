//
// Spec: concurrency-lifetime-safety-audit — Task 2 (Category B reproduction).
// Shared support utilities for the ThreadSanitizer (TSan) data-race
// reproduction tests (defects 1.4 and 1.5).
//
// This header is intentionally header-only and race-free in itself: every
// piece of test-side shared state uses std::atomic and all worker threads are
// joined before any result is read on the main thread. The ONLY data race a
// TSan build should report from these tests is the *production* race under
// audit (AuthorizationFilter::loadConfig for 1.4, JwkManager init/read for
// 1.5) — never the harness.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// TSan gating (OAUTH2_TSAN_ENABLED / kTsanEnabled)
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// These are *reproduction* tests whose detection mechanism is ThreadSanitizer.
// The genuine concurrent path they exercise is, by definition, an unsynchronized
// data race in the UNFIXED production code:
//   * 1.4 races concurrent std::vector::push_back on the same vector — that is
//     undefined behavior that CAN corrupt the heap and crash even WITHOUT a
//     sanitizer on a normal build.
//   * 1.5 races a std::string assignment vs concurrent reads — also UB.
//
// To keep the suite runnable and crash-free on a normal (non-instrumented)
// build while still RELIABLY tripping TSan when built with -fsanitize=thread,
// we decide at RUNTIME (via the compile-time-detected `kTsanEnabled`) whether
// to launch the genuine racing workload:
//   * Under TSan  -> run the real concurrent reproduction (TSan reports the
//                    race; the bug-condition test FAILS, which is the SUCCESS
//                    case for an exploratory reproduction on unfixed code).
//   * Normal build -> run a SAFE, serialized exercise of the same production
//                     code path (compiles the racing code for coverage but
//                     never executes it concurrently), and the test passes
//                     trivially WITHOUT claiming any race was detected.
//
// We use a plain runtime `if (kTsanEnabled)` (NOT `if constexpr`) on purpose,
// so BOTH branches are always compiled — giving the normal build full compile
// coverage of the racing code without ever running it.
//
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// ASan gating (OAUTH2_ASAN_ENABLED / kAsanEnabled) — added for Task 3
// ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
// Task 3 (Category C) reproduces heap-use-after-free under AddressSanitizer:
// an object is destroyed while one of its async callbacks is still in flight,
// and the in-flight callback then dereferences a dangling `this` / raw pointer
// to touch already-freed members. Just like the TSan gating above, the GENUINE
// use-after-free is undefined behavior that can crash / corrupt the heap even
// WITHOUT a sanitizer on a normal build, so we gate it on `kAsanEnabled`:
//   * Under ASan  -> reset the owner BEFORE firing the in-flight callback, so
//                    the callback runs against freed memory; ASan reports
//                    `heap-use-after-free` and aborts — the bug-condition test
//                    FAILS, which is the SUCCESS case for an exploratory
//                    reproduction on unfixed code.
//   * Normal build -> fire the in-flight callback BEFORE the owner is reset
//                     (lifetime-safe ordering): the SAME production code path
//                     runs against a LIVE object (full compile + run coverage,
//                     no UB) and the test passes deterministically WITHOUT
//                     claiming any UAF was detected.
// As with TSan, use a plain runtime `if (kAsanEnabled)` (NOT `if constexpr`) so
// BOTH orderings always compile.

// the queued callback afterwards — exactly the "object destroyed before the
// in-flight callback arrives" timing.

// touches the object under test on its own. The ONLY dangling access is the
